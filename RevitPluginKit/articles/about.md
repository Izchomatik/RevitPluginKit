## About project

RevitPluginKit is a set of tools and utilities designed to simplify the creation of a custom plug-in for the "Autodesk Revit" program.

The library is intended primarily to simplify work with "Revit API" and standardize the processes associated with the preparation of a custom plugin for the Revit program.

RevitPluginKit provides tools for convenient "Revit" ribbon panel generation, feature sets such as fast and simple model elements collectors, set of converters, validators and many other tools.
